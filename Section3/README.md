## And now, for the grand finale...

Because why stop at just one AI project, right? Our execs apparently sat through a super cool presentation by someone at OpenAI, and naturally, they got inspired. (Read: They’ve had another one of those “brilliant” ideas.) So now, thanks to the combined brainpower of the marketing team, sales, and probably a lot of coffee, we’re adding an AI doghouse designer to our webstore! 🐶🏠

Here’s the big idea: We’re going to let customers design their own doghouse, just by answering a few simple questions—like size, color, style, and where it’ll be located. Then, like magic, the AI will whip up a concept picture that’ll make the customer go, “Wow, I didn’t know I needed this, but now I definitely do!” And just like that, they can buy the doghouse on the spot.

But wait, there’s a catch. (Of course there is. There’s always a catch.) We need to make sure that Datadog is keeping a watchful eye on this whole process, making sure everything runs smoothly, and that our AI doesn’t start generating doghouses that look like they were designed by Picasso on a caffeine binge. 🎨

So, here’s your next set of heroic tasks:

1. Build the Designer - First, integrate the AI doghouse designer into the webstore. Make sure it’s intuitive enough for a toddler to use, because let’s face it, customers are just bigger toddlers with credit cards.

2. AI Quality Control - Once it’s up and running, you’ll need to ensure that the AI is generating doghouses that don’t make our customers question their life choices. If it starts suggesting purple doghouses with disco balls, maybe tweak the settings a bit.

3. Datadog Monitoring - And finally, yes, you guessed it: ensure Datadog is diligently observing this new masterpiece. We need to make sure the whole thing doesn’t crash and burn—or worse, start generating doghouses that violate several building codes.

So there you have it—your final challenge in this epic saga. If you pull this off, not only will our webstore be the talk of the town, but you might even get a doghouse named after you. Or at least, a really nice thank you email. (But don’t hold your breath on that one.) 😜

Good luck, and may the code be ever in your favor! 🧙‍♂️🐕🏠
